            <h2>Dissertation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Job Market Paper: “Why Money Isn't Neutral”
                    Abstract: This paper argues that redistributive politics are not accidental byproducts of monetary policy but its enduring logic. Discretionary authority transforms monetary policy from a neutral instrument of stabilization 
                    into a political process of allocation. Drawing on Richard Cantillon’s insight that new money alters relative prices and redistributes purchasing power toward early recipients, the paper shows that under central banking these 
                    effects become structural features of discretion. Linking the Fed's institutional channels to Cantillon Effects, it demonstrates how access and influence to the Fed convert monetary discretion into predictable patterns of 
                    redistribution. It utilizes three historical cases—the Fed’s first purchases of agency debt in the 1970s,the Commercial Paper Crisis of 1970, and the Plaza Accord of 1985— to illustrate how special interests repeatedly leveraged 
                    these institutional pathways to steer credit in their favor. The analysis reframes the rules–discretion debate as a question of political economy. Rules constrain the scope for monetary bargaining, while discretion embeds politics 
                    within the very structure of money creation.</li>
                <li>Chapter 1: “From Technical Control to Constitutional Design: Milton Friedman and the Politics of Monetary Order” 
                    Abstract: This paper reconstructs Milton Friedman’s intellectual trajectory from the 1940s to the 1990s to show how his conception of monetary order evolved from a problem of technical control to one of constitutional and distributive 
                    design. Early in his career, Friedman treated monetary instability as a failure of expertise where better data, rules of thumb, and professional judgment could perfect policy instruments. Yet the politicization of central banking and 
                    the emergence of inflationary cycles in the 1970s revealed that monetary instability stemmed from political incentives, not technical errors. As he confronted the limits of technocratic management, Friedman’s role shifted from detached 
                    economist to public advocate, mirroring his growing awareness of the logic of public choice, that stable policy requires rules that bind politicians as well as economists. His later writings reframed monetary history as a record of 
                    redistribution and special-interest capture, emphasizing that money’s neutrality is an illusion sustained by fragile institutions. The paper situatesthis evolution within the broader twentieth-century transition from the economics of 
                    control to the politicaleconomy of rules, arguing that Friedman’s enduring commitment to monetary rules ultimately matured into aconstitutional and moral defense against the redistributive misuse of money.</li>
                <li>Chapter 2: “Wall Street Against Wheat Fields: Redistributive Politics from the Fed’s Founding to Roosevelt’s Devaluation”
                    Abstract: This paper examines the early history of the Fed and interprets it as a struggle among competing economic interests for control over the monetary system. Conceived in 1913 as a compromise between advocates of centralized finance 
                    and champions of regional representation, the new central bank quickly became dominated by the financial priorities of New York and the Treasury. Wartime finance and the discovery of open-market operations reinforced this orientation, 
                    channeling liquidity to money markets rather than rural banks. In the 1920s, the congressional farm bloc mounted a sustained campaign to redirect credit toward agriculture through legislation such as the Agricultural Credits Act of 1923, 
                    but the Fed’s administrative discretion neutralized these efforts. Only with the onset of the Great Depression did the farm bloc finally secure monetary relief, not through the Fed itself but through Roosevelt’s gold devaluation of 1933. 
                    Tracing these episodes from founding to crisis, the paper argues that the formative decades of the Fed reveal a contest between financial and agrarian coalitions to harness the redistributive capabilities of money creation.</li>
